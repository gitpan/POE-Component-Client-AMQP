NAME
    POE::Component::Client::AMQP - Asynchronous AMQP client implementation
    in POE

SYNOPSIS
      use POE::Component::Client::AMQP;

      Net::AMQP::Protocol->load_xml_spec('amqp0-8.xml');

      my $amq = POE::Component::Client::AMQP->create(
          RemoteAddress => 'mq.domain.tld',
      );

      $amq->channel(1)->queue('frank')->subscribe(sub {
          my ($payload, $meta) = @_;

          my $reply_to = $meta->{header_frame}->reply_to;

          $amq->channel(1)->queue($reply_to)->publish("Message received");
      });

      $amq->run();

DESCRIPTION
    This module implements the Advanced Message Queue Protocol (AMQP) TCP/IP
    client. It's goal is to provide users with a quick and easy way of using
    AMQP while at the same time exposing the advanced functionality of the
    protocol if needed.

    The (de)serialization and representation logic is handled by Net::AMQP,
    which needs to be setup (via load_xml_spec()) prior to this client
    software running. Please see the docs there for further information on
    this.

USAGE
  create
      my $amq = POE::Component::Client::AMQP->create(
          RemoteAddress => 'mq.domain.tld',
      );

    Create a new AMQP client. Arguments to this method:

    *RemoteAddress* (default: 127.0.0.1)
        Connect to this host

    *RemotePort* (default: 5672)
    *Username* (default: guest)
    *Password* (default: guest)
    *VirtualHost* (default: /)
    *Logger* (default: simple screen logger)
        Provide an object which implements 'debug', 'info' and 'error'
        logging methods (such as Log::Log4perl).

    *Debug*
        This module provides extensive debugging options. These are
        specified as a hash as follows:

        *logic* (boolean)
            Display decisions the code is making

        *frame_input* (boolean)
        *frame_output* (boolean)
            Use the *frame_dumper* code to display frames that come in from
            or out to the server.

        *frame_dumper* (coderef)
            A coderef which, given a Net::AMQP::Frame object, will return a
            string representation of it, prefixed with "\n".

        *raw_input* (boolean)
        *raw_output* (boolean)
            Use the *raw_dumper* code to display raw data that comes in from
            or out to the server.

        *raw_dumper* (coderef)
            A coderef which, given a raw string, will return a byte
            representation of it, prefixed with "\n".

    *Keepalive* (default: 0)
        If set, will send a Net::AMQP::Frame::Heartbeat frame every
        Keepalive seconds after the last activity on the connection. This is
        a mechanism to keep a long-open TCP session alive.

    *Alias* (default: amqp_client)
        The POE session alias of the main client session

    *AliasTCP* (default: tcp_client)
        The POE session alias of the TCP client

    *Callbacks* (default: {})
        Provide callbacks. At the moment, 'Startup' and 'FrameSent' are the
        only recognized callback.

        FrameSent will be called with $self and the Net::AMQP::Frame being
        sent.

    *is_testing*
        Set to '1' to avoid creating POE::Sessions (mainly useful in t/
        scripts)

    Returns a class object.

CLASS METHODS
  do_when_startup (...)
        Pass a subref that should be executed after the client has connected
        and authenticated with the remote AMQP server. If the client is
        already connected and authenticated, the subref will be called
        immediately. Think: deferred.

  channel ($id)
        Call with an optional argument $id (1 - 65536). Returns a
        POE::Component::Client::AMQP::Channel object which can be used
        immediately.

  run ()
        Shortcut to calling $poe_kernel->run

  stop ()
        Shortcut to calling the POE state 'disconnect'

  compose_basic_publish ($payload, %options)
        A helper method to generate the frames necessary for a basic
        publish. Returns a Net::AMQP::Protocol::Basic::Publish,
        Net::AMQP::Frame::Header (wrapping a
        Net::AMQP::Protocol::Basic::ContentHeader frame) followed by zero or
        more Net::AMQP::Frame::Body frames. Since the arguments for each one
        of these frames are unique, the %options hash provides options for
        all of the frames.

        The following options are supported, all of which are optional, some
        having sane defaults:

        *Header options*

            *weight* (default: 0)

        *Method options*

            *ticket* (default: 0)
            *exchange*
            *routing_key*
            *mandatory* (default: 1)
            *immediate*

        *Content options*

            *content_type*
            *content_encoding*
            *headers* (default: {})
            *delivery_mode* (default: 1)
            *priority* (default: 1)
            *correlation_id*
            *reply_to*
            *expiration*
            *message_id*
            *timestamp*
            *type*
            *user_id*
            *app_id*
            *cluster_id*

POE STATES
    The following are states you can post to to interact with the client.
    Use the alias defined in the "create()" call above.

  server_disconnect
        Send a Connection.Close request

  server_send (@output)
        Pass one or more Net::AMQP::Frame objects. For short hand, you may
        pass Net::AMQP::Protocol::Base objects, which will be automatically
        wrapped in the appropriate frame type, with channel 0. These frames
        will be written to the server. In the case of
        Net::AMQP::Frame::Method objects which are calling a synchronous
        method, the client will handle them one at a time, waiting until a
        synchronous method returns properly before sending further
        synchronous frames. This happens automatically.

  shutdown ()
        If you need to stop things immediately, call shutdown(). This is not
        graceful.

  keepalive
    Sends a Heartbeat frame at a regular interval to keep the TCP session
    from timing out.
