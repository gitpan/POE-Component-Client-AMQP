These examples are perl versions of some examples found in the Ruby/EventMachine
AMQP implementation (http://github.com/tmm1/amqp).  To run them, first start up
an AMQP server, such as RabbitMQ:

  hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-codegen
  hg clone http://hg.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-server
  cd rabbitmq-server
  make run

cd into this directory and type the example name:

  ./pingpong.pl    # 1-1 communication with amq.direct
  ./ack.pl         # using ack

By default they require YAML::XS and Term::ANSIColor, and display colored debug
output of the operations of the program.  To turn this off, prefix the program
with DEBUG=0.  You can edit 'examples.pm' to customize what debug output you'd
like to see.
